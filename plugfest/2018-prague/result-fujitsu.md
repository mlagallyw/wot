# Plugfest result in Prague

# 1. Introduction

This document describes the result of WoT plugfest held in Prague on 24-5 of March, 2018.

## 1.1 Participants

Oracle, Ericsson, EURECOM, Fujitsu, Hitachi, Intel, Internet Research Institute, The Paciello Group, Panasonic, SmartThings/Samsung Research, Siemens, Technical University of Munich(TUM)

## 1.2 WoT Servients

The drawing below is the ocnfiguration for the Prague plugfest.

# 2. Evaluation on checking points in Prague plugfest

## 2.1 Connect with remote/local proxy (narrow waist model)

![connect with proxies](images/diagram01.png)

### Fujitsu
   We provide one remote proxy in Nagoya and two local proxies.
   One local proxy is placed in Smart Home in Japan, and three devices(LED Light, AirConditioner, Blind) connect it by ECHONET Lite.
   Another local proxy is placed in PlugFest Place, and two devices(Rotating Light, Brightness Sensor) connect it.
   And our application(node-red) connect remote proxy and control devices.


## 2.2 Application servient

### Fujitsu
   We use Node-RED to lookup TD and set/get property value and Action.
   Nimura-san use scripting api.


## 2.3 Connect with node-wot

### Fujitsu
   (future work)


## 2.4 Scripting API

![scripting api](images/diagram04.png)

### Fujitsu
   We provide Application Servient that supports ConsumedThing of ScriptingAPI and Device Servient that support ExposedThing of ScriptingAPI.


## 2.5 Thing Directory 

![Thing Directory](images/diagram05.png)

### Fujitsu
   We provide simple one. Application Servients can lookup TDs by specifying the device's name.


## 2.6 Many kinds of device servients

### Fujitsu
   Local Devices: Rotary Beacon Light(connectet by EtherCAT) and Brightness Sensor(connectet by BLE)
   Remote Devices(in Japan): LED Light, Blind and Airconditioner (connected by Echonet LITE)


## 2.7 Device simulators

### Fujitsu
   (future work)


## 2.8 Semantic discovery

### Fujitsu
   (future work)


## 2.9 Security

![security accessibility](images/diagram08.png)

### Fujitsu
   We use bearer token for access the remote/local proxy.
   And also use bearer token between remote proxy and local proxy.


## 2.10 Accessibility

### Fujitsu
   (future work)


## 2.11 Event handling with long polling

### Fujitsu
   Our Remote and Local proxy support SSE and Long Polling.
   Brightness Sensor support long polling


# 3. Issues for the next plugfest

## 3.1 followings should be improved for next:
- Use the same schema between members
- Security
- Accessibility

## 3.2 Thing directory will be specified more detail
- Two different interfaces provided by Siemens and Fujitsu
- Directory interface should be specified
- Roles of directory and proxy should be specified in Fujitsu proxy
## 3.3 Web browser as a WoT Servient will be connected
- Fujitsu and Panasonic implemented 

## 3.4 Collecting TD and servient information should be needed
- Please upload your TDs to github and give some explanation of your servients.

## 3.5 Network topology variations
- Collect use cases of network topology.

## 3.6 Interface between servients
- Specify interface and sequence diagram
- Describe these in appendix of Architecture document.

## 3.7 Meta applications

## 3.8 CORS issue when using Scripting app on browser. (inserted by Panasonic)
- To be accessed by browser through XMLHTTPRequest, WoT Servients need to add "Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * " header in it's response to the requests including OPTIONS method.

## 3.9 Multiple "form" issue when using Fujitsu proxy (inserted by Panasonic)
- Fujitsu proxy currently does not support multiple "form" for one property.
- In Panasonic TD, "read/write" and "observe" to a same property is expressed as two different HTTP endpoints
  ->changes to two different property were necessary.
